Code:
# 🔍 Competitor Feature Gaps for Students - AI Content Lab & Job Finder Pro Opportunity

This document identifies key gaps in existing career platforms (LinkedIn, Handshake, Indeed, etc.) that Job Finder Pro can fill—especially focusing on student needs and AI content generation.

---

## 🎯 Summary of Key Competitors

| Platform | Target Audience | Relevant Features |
|---|---|---|
| **LinkedIn** | Professionals (including students) | LinkedIn Profile, Job Search, Networking, LinkedIn Post Assist |
| **Handshake** | Students & recent grads | University job boards, employer outreach, career events |
| **Indeed** | General job seekers | Resume upload, job search, Indeed Career Guide |
| **Zety / Resume.io / Canva** | General users | Online resume and cover letter builders |
| **Jasper AI / Copy.ai / GrammarlyGO** | Marketers & content creators | AI writing tools, not student/job-search specific |

---

## 📌 Feature Gaps in Existing Platforms (Relevant to Students)

| Pain Point for Students | Gap in Competitors | Job Finder Pro Opportunity |
|---|---|---|
| **End-to-end job search + content creation in one tool** | No single platform blends job search, CRM tracking, and AI writing | Job Finder Pro offers an integrated experience |
| **Student-focused AI content generation** | LinkedIn Post Assist exists, but it lacks resume/cover letter/bio creation focused on students | AI Content Lab directly targets student scenarios |
| **AI-powered resume and cover letter bullet generation** | Indeed Resume and Handshake don’t offer AI bullet writing tools | Resume Builder + AI Content Lab can fill this gap |
| **Persona-aware tone adjustments** | No platform dynamically adjusts tone for "Student", "Coach", "Employer", etc. | Job Finder Pro has Persona Selector for AI output |
| **In-flow AI tips for job content writing** | Competitors don’t provide contextual AI writing tips inside user flows | Job Finder Pro’s InFlowAITipsPanel does this |
| **Cross-module draft management** | No competitor tracks writing drafts across resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, etc. | AI Content Lab’s DraftHistorySidebar and future cross-module draft manager |
| **Beginner-mode content templates for first-time job seekers** | Most platforms assume users know what a good LinkedIn post or cover letter looks like | Job Finder Pro can include starter templates and AI prompt suggestions |
| **Real-time resume tailoring based on job description** | No student-focused tool integrates job description analysis into resume writing | Potential future feature for Job Finder Pro (AI job-tailored resume recommendations) |

---

## 📌 Specific Differentiators for AI Content Lab (Student Focus)

- ✅ Pre-built student content types (LinkedIn summaries, project-to-resume conversion, outreach messages)  
- ✅ Persona-driven tone guidance  
- ✅ Module-aware AI writing (drafts created inside Application Tracker, Resume Builder, etc., auto-feed into Content Lab)  
- ✅ Draft history for version control  
- ✅ Future scalability: AI response refinement, scoring, and export options  

---

## ✅ Competitive Advantage Summary:

**Job Finder Pro + AI Content Lab** has the opportunity to become the **first truly student-centric career platform with integrated AI content creation**, filling major gaps left by LinkedIn, Handshake, Indeed, and generic AI writing tools.

Code:
# @adobe/css-tools

> This is a fork of the npm css package due to low maintenance

CSS parser / stringifier.

## Installation

    $ npm install @adobe/css-tools

## Usage

```js
import { parse, stringify } from '@adobe/css-tools'
let obj = parse('body { font-size: 12px; }', options);
let css = stringify(obj, options);
```

## API

### parse(code, [options])

Accepts a CSS string and returns an AST `object`.

`options`:

- silent: silently fail on parse errors.
- source: the path to the file containing `css`. Makes errors and source
  maps more helpful, by letting them know where code comes from.

### stringify(object, [options])

Accepts an AST `object` (as `css.parse` produces) and returns a CSS string.

`options`:

- indent: the string used to indent the output. Defaults to two spaces.
- compress: omit comments and extraneous whitespace.

### Example

```js
var ast = parse('body { font-size: 12px; }', { source: 'source.css' });

var css = stringify(ast);
```

### Errors

Errors thrown during parsing have the following properties:

- message: `String`. The full error message with the source position.
- reason: `String`. The error message without position.
- filename: `String` or `undefined`. The value of `options.source` if
  passed to `css.parse`. Otherwise `undefined`.
- line: `Integer`.
- column: `Integer`.
- source: `String`. The portion of code that couldn't be parsed.

When parsing with the `silent` option, errors are listed in the
`parsingErrors` property of the [`stylesheet`](#stylesheet) node instead
of being thrown.

If you create any errors in plugins such as in
[rework](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework), you __must__ set the same
properties for consistency.

## AST

Interactively explore the AST with <http://iamdustan.com/reworkcss_ast_explorer/>.

### Common properties

All nodes have the following properties.

#### position

Information about the position in the source string that corresponds to
the node.

`Object`:

- start: `Object`:
  - line: `Number`.
  - column: `Number`.
- end: `Object`:
  - line: `Number`.
  - column: `Number`.
- source: `String` or `undefined`. The value of `options.source` if passed to
  `css.parse`. Otherwise `undefined`.
- content: `String`. The full source string passed to `css.parse`.

The line and column numbers are 1-based: The first line is 1 and the first
column of a line is 1 (not 0).

The `position` property lets you know from which source file the node comes
from (if available), what that file contains, and what part of that file was
parsed into the node.

#### type

`String`. The possible values are the ones listed in the Types section below.

#### parent

A reference to the parent node, or `null` if the node has no parent.

### Types

The available values of `node.type` are listed below, as well as the available
properties of each node (other than the common properties listed above.)

#### stylesheet

The root node returned by `css.parse`.

- stylesheet: `Object`:
  - rules: `Array` of nodes with the types `rule`, `comment` and any of the
    at-rule types.
  - parsingErrors: `Array` of `Error`s. Errors collected during parsing when
    option `silent` is true.

#### rule

- selectors: `Array` of `String`s. The list of selectors of the rule, split
  on commas. Each selector is trimmed from whitespace and comments.
- declarations: `Array` of nodes with the types `declaration` and `comment`.

#### declaration

- property: `String`. The property name, trimmed from whitespace and
  comments. May not be empty.
- value: `String`. The value of the property, trimmed from whitespace and
  comments. Empty values are allowed.

#### comment

A rule-level or declaration-level comment. Comments inside selectors,
properties and values etc. are lost.

- comment: `String`. The part between the starting `/*` and the ending `*/`
  of the comment, including whitespace.

#### charset

The `@charset` at-rule.

- charset: `String`. The part following `@charset `.

#### custom-media

The `@custom-media` at-rule.

# @ampproject/remapping

> Remap sequential sourcemaps through transformations to point at the original source code

Remapping allows you to take the sourcemaps generated through transforming your code and "remap"
them to the original source locations. Think "my minified code, transformed with babel and bundled
with webpack", all pointing to the correct location in your original source code.

With remapping, none of your source code transformations need to be aware of the input's sourcemap,
they only need to generate an output sourcemap. This greatly simplifies building custom
transformations (think a find-and-replace).

## Installation

```sh
npm install @ampproject/remapping
```

## Usage

```typescript
function remapping(
  map: SourceMap | SourceMap[],
  loader: (file: string, ctx: LoaderContext) => (SourceMap | null | undefined),
  options?: { excludeContent: boolean, decodedMappings: boolean }
): SourceMap;

// LoaderContext gives the loader the importing sourcemap, tree depth, the ability to override the
// "source" location (where child sources are resolved relative to, or the location of original
// source), and the ability to override the "content" of an original source for inclusion in the
// output sourcemap.
type LoaderContext = {
 readonly importer: string;
 readonly depth: number;
 source: string;
 content: string | null | undefined;
}
```

`remapping` takes the final output sourcemap, and a `loader` function. For every source file pointer
in the sourcemap, the `loader` will be called with the resolved path. If the path itself represents
a transformed file (it has a sourcmap associated with it), then the `loader` should return that
sourcemap. If not, the path will be treated as an original, untransformed source code.

```js
// Babel transformed "helloworld.js" into "transformed.js"
const transformedMap = JSON.stringify({
  file: 'transformed.js',
  // 1st column of 2nd line of output file translates into the 1st source
  // file, line 3, column 2
  mappings: ';CAEE',
  sources: ['helloworld.js'],
  version: 3,
});

// Uglify minified "transformed.js" into "transformed.min.js"
const minifiedTransformedMap = JSON.stringify({
  file: 'transformed.min.js',
  // 0th column of 1st line of output file translates into the 1st source
  // file, line 2, column 1.
  mappings: 'AACC',
  names: [],
  sources: ['transformed.js'],
  version: 3,
});

const remapped = remapping(
  minifiedTransformedMap,
  (file, ctx) => {

    // The "transformed.js" file is an transformed file.
    if (file === 'transformed.js') {
      // The root importer is empty.
      console.assert(ctx.importer === '');
      // The depth in the sourcemap tree we're currently loading.
      // The root `minifiedTransformedMap` is depth 0, and its source children are depth 1, etc.
      console.assert(ctx.depth === 1);

      return transformedMap;
    }

    // Loader will be called to load transformedMap's source file pointers as well.
    console.assert(file === 'helloworld.js');
    // `transformed.js`'s sourcemap points into `helloworld.js`.
    console.assert(ctx.importer === 'transformed.js');
    // This is a source child of `transformed`, which is a source child of `minifiedTransformedMap`.
    console.assert(ctx.depth === 2);
    return null;
  }
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   file: 'transpiled.min.js',
//   mappings: 'AAEE',
//   sources: ['helloworld.js'],
//   version: 3,
// };
```

In this example, `loader` will be called twice:

1. `"transformed.js"`, the first source file pointer in the `minifiedTransformedMap`. We return the
   associated sourcemap for it (its a transformed file, after all) so that sourcemap locations can
   be traced through it into the source files it represents.
2. `"helloworld.js"`, our original, unmodified source code. This file does not have a sourcemap, so
   we return `null`.

The `remapped` sourcemap now points from `transformed.min.js` into locations in `helloworld.js`. If
you were to read the `mappings`, it says "0th column of the first line output line points to the 1st
column of the 2nd line of the file `helloworld.js`".

### Multiple transformations of a file

As a convenience, if you have multiple single-source transformations of a file, you may pass an
array of sourcemap files in the order of most-recent transformation sourcemap first. Note that this
changes the `importer` and `depth` of each call to our loader. So our above example could have been
written as:

```js
const remapped = remapping(
  [minifiedTransformedMap, transformedMap],
  () => null
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   file: 'transpiled.min.js',
//   mappings: 'AAEE',
//   sources: ['helloworld.js'],
//   version: 3,
// };
```

### Advanced control of the loading graph

#### `source`

The `source` property can overridden to any value to change the location of the current load. Eg,
for an original source file, it allows us to change the location to the original source regardless
of what the sourcemap source entry says. And for transformed files, it allows us to change the
relative resolving location for child sources of the loaded sourcemap.

```js
const remapped = remapping(
  minifiedTransformedMap,
  (file, ctx) => {

    if (file === 'transformed.js') {
      // We pretend the transformed.js file actually exists in the 'src/' directory. When the nested
      // source files are loaded, they will now be relative to `src/`.
      ctx.source = 'src/transformed.js';
      return transformedMap;
    }

    console.assert(file === 'src/helloworld.js');
    // We could futher change the source of this original file, eg, to be inside a nested directory
    // itself. This will be reflected in the remapped sourcemap.
    ctx.source = 'src/nested/transformed.js';
    return null;
  }
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   …,
//   sources: ['src/nested/helloworld.js'],
// };
```


#### `content`

The `content` property can be overridden when we encounter an original source file. Eg, this allows
you to manually provide the source content of the original file regardless of whether the
`sourcesContent` field is present in the parent sourcemap. It can also be set to `null` to remove
the source content.

```js
const remapped = remapping(
  minifiedTransformedMap,
  (file, ctx) => {

    if (file === 'transformed.js') {
      // transformedMap does not include a `sourcesContent` field, so usually the remapped sourcemap
      // would not include any `sourcesContent` values.
      return transformedMap;
    }

    console.assert(file === 'helloworld.js');
    // We can read the file to provide the source content.
    ctx.content = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    return null;
  }
);

console.log(remapped);
// {
//   …,
//   sourcesContent: [
//     'console.log("Hello world!")',
//   ],
// };
```

### Options

#### excludeContent

By default, `excludeContent` is `false`. Passing `{ excludeContent: true }` will exclude the
`sourcesContent` field from the returned sourcemap. This is mainly useful when you want to reduce
the size out the sourcemap.

#### decodedMappings

By default, `decodedMappings` is `false`. Passing `{ decodedMappings: true }` will leave the
`mappings` field in a [decoded state](https://github.com/rich-harris/sourcemap-codec) instead of
encoding into a VLQ string.
